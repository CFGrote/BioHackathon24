| [OME-XML](https://ome-model.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ome-xml/index.html)     |  file format for storing microscopy information (both pixels and metadata) using the OME Data Model; superseded by OME-TIFF, which is the container format for image data  making use of the OME Data Model      |
|   [OME-Zarr/NGFF](https://ngff.openmicroscopy.org/latest/)     | a specific implementation of the Zarr format tailored for bioimaging data for storing data in the cloud, incorporates metadata compliant with the OME model       |
| HDF5 | (Hierarchical Data Format) Widely used for storing large datasets, it supports complex data models and is commonly utilized in bioimaging|
|NetCDF|Suitable for multidimensional data, it is often used in scientific research for storing array-oriented data.|
